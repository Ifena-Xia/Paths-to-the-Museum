<h1>Paths to the Museum: Parental Education and Children’s Cultural Participation in China</h1>

<p><strong>Author:</strong> Yifang Xia</p>

<h2>1. Why Does Museum Participation Matter?</h2>
  
<p>Museum participation is not simply a matter of leisure—it is a form of learning, cultural identification, and long-term civic development. Sandell & Zimmerman (2017), Lin et al. (2023) highlight the potential of museum environments to shape reflective teaching and interactive learning. Holmes (2011), Acosta & Haden (2022) show that even brief museum-based tinkering experiences can generate gains in science learning and reflective thinking, particularly when scaffolded by facilitation and parents’ own education. Early museum visits foster children’s cognitive, creative, and social capacities (Cronin et al., 2020), and support learning transfer into the home environment, where caregivers mediate and extend the experience. Temple and Gan (2023) demonstrate that early involvement in cultural activities significantly predicts lifelong engagement, especially among men. Paredes (2016) illustrates immigrant identity may inspire engagement with museums as spaces for cultural validation and civic inclusion. In this way, museums act not only as educational tools but as vehicles of intergenerational transmission.</p>

<p>More broadly, participation in cultural life carries long-term implications for wellbeing. Løkken et al. (2020) find that cultural engagement, including receptive activities like museum visits, is associated with reduced all-cause mortality.</p>

<h2>2. What Influences Cultural Participation?</h2>
  
<p>Despite their growing visibility as educational environments, museums remain unequally accessed and unevenly experienced. Across contexts, one predictor stands out: education, especially parental education, emerges as the most consistent determinant of cultural participation (Falk & Katz-Gerro, 2016; Zieba, 2017). Tertiary education increases both the probability and frequency of attendance (Muñiz et al., 2017; Suarez-Fernandez et al., 2020; Bone et al., 2021), often surpassing income or occupational class in explanatory power (Haag & Specht, 2022; Fiorillo & Ofria, 2024). Cultural engagement is shaped not only by access to resources, but by the ability to navigate and decode highbrow spaces (Brida et al., 2016). This cultural capital, deeply embedded in class-based educational trajectories, is transmitted through families over time (Váradi & Józsa, 2023; Crispin & Beck, 2025).</p>

<p>Studies have extended this insight to children’s participation in cultural life. Mak and Fancourt (2021) show that out-of-school participation in arts and cultural activities is strongly predicted by parents’ own cultural engagement, neighborhood deprivation, and socioeconomic status. While school-based programs may flatten inequality temporarily, family influence remains the dominant force in long-term participation (Temple & Gan, 2023). Borrione et al. (2021) further observe that frequent-attending families tend to value museum staff expertise, educational content, and learning outcomes, while infrequent-attending families prioritize rest areas, multimedia, and play, suggesting that class-based orientations influence not just whether, but how families engage with museums.</p>

<p>Geography compounds these divides. Spatial barriers, including rural residence, neighborhood deprivation, and infrastructure scarcity, affect both access and perceived cultural belonging (Mak et al., 2021; Rodríguez-Puello & Iturra, 2024). Intra-household studies like Ateca-Amestoy and Ugidos (2021) reveal that women’s participation in cultural life is further shaped by childcare responsibilities and mobility constraints, suggesting that structural inequalities—not just preferences—govern family engagement with museums. Olivares and Piatak (2022) add a racial lens, showing that Black Americans are significantly less likely to attend museums than white peers, even after controlling for education and income. Yet Latinx and Black respondents are more likely to cite cultural heritage as a motivation for attendance, emphasizing the importance of representation and institutional culture.</p>

<p>At the macro level, Ateca-Amestoy & Prieto-Rodriguez (2024) confirm that education explains more inequality in cultural participation than race or geography. Importantly, these inequalities are mirrored in digital spaces, undermining the idea that online access resolves exclusion. Instead, cultural engagement, whether live or digital, remains clustered among the already-engaged.</p>

<h2>3. The Case of China</h2>
  
<p>Despite rapid museum development in China, access remains unequal. Free admission doesn’t guarantee inclusion: digital booking, lack of signage, or limited programs still exclude disadvantaged groups. Using CEPS data, this study explores how parental education shapes children’s museum participation across urban and rural regions.</p>

<h2>4. Data and Methods</h2>
<p>The study draws on CEPS data from 19,487 families. After cleaning, 9,761 records with full responses were analyzed. Variables include participation frequency, parental education, gender, grade, siblings, living arrangement, and urbanicity level.</p>

<h2>5. Regression Models</h2>
<p><strong>OLS Model:</strong> Parental education is positively associated with participation frequency. Living in rural areas, having siblings, or being in 9th grade reduce likelihood. Interaction terms suggest education mitigates rural disadvantage.</p>

<p><strong>Binary Logistic Model:</strong> High parental education increases the odds of higher participation. Female gender, no siblings, and urban residence also positively impact likelihood.</p>

<p><strong>Multinomial Logistic Model:</strong> Parental education significantly predicts both moderate and high levels of participation compared to low. Urban students again show advantage.</p>

<h2>6. Reflection on Interaction Terms</h2>
<p>Initially, the interaction between parental education and urbanicity was statistically significant. After recoding and cleaning, this interaction weakened. This highlights how technical adjustments can obscure deeper social patterns in the data.</p>

<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Parental education and geographic location are the most consistent predictors of cultural participation. Despite equalizing efforts like free admission, museums remain unequally accessed. Policymakers must address deeper structural barriers—supporting inclusive design, reducing academic pressure, and funding cultural access in underserved areas.</p>
